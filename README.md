================================

Thanks for checking out my work.

Feel free to contact me anytime.
(3 am can be tricky but you never know...)


======================================================

**Webpack Development build works.**

**Webpack Production build works**

Notes:
- Added scripts to package.json:
- "preinstall" script adds `.metadata_never_index` file to `node_modules` directory
- "build" script adds `.metadata_never_index` file to `dist` directory
- Issue - modal buttons not being processed. **SOLVED**
  - Issue was the require statement return was commented out in the modal-button.vue getPic() function.

======================================================

**Note not all sections and modals have images**

Only the following modals have slideshow images: 
- print/advil
- print/amex
- print/bayer
- Work in progress...

======================================================

In the (not so) early stages of setting up:

**Webpack 2 config with various features, including:**
- Updated Config 7/2/17 - running the latest versions of all packages.
- Hot Module Reloading
- Image/Fonts/etc. Processing
- Path Aliases
- dev-server
- Vendor library code splitting
- etc. 


**Vue 2 project:**

Need to update imports and reruires to new format for

GSAP Animation (only modal-slideshow has GSAP animations applied but not in a Vue way - using jquery):

- CSSPlugin
- ScrollToPlugin

Simplifying the Build:
Todo:
- Cleaning up the CSS.

- Cleaning up the HTML.
- Need to update `import` and `reruire` to new format for for vue-loader v13.x.x. **DONE**
- Need to not bind TweenMax and ScrollToPlugin to window within main.js
  - Bad practice only bind within the componets where it is needed.
- Organized assets/img folder all art and code links updated to match new structure.
  - Set new folder/file structure.
  - Researching if it is possible to hash the Copy Webpack Plugin images and JSON files. Not sure how to get the hashes Copy Webpack Plugin images/assets. **SOLVED**
